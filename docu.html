        <h3 id="what">What is MetaHandle?</h3>
        <font size="4"><p>MetaHandles are Bitcoin transactions which reference to another transaction and a keyword chosen by the users. This enables a user to search for a keyword and find another transaction.</p>
        <h3 id="why">Why you need MetaHandle</h3>
         <font size="4"><p>A major problem of onchain content is that it is referenced by a transaction id, like <code>0478a101336483d878bccec3c82bb97e8aea7f0c3c4dbf65c1ef910957b558c8</code> which is impossible to memorize. The result is that you need to keep long lists of bookmarks with onchain links or transaction ids.</p><p>MetaHandle solves this problem by allowing you to create bookmarks or tags for any onchain content. Beside this they allow you to add value to a transaction or to claim an exclusive handle for a keyword.</p>
        <h3 id="basic">Creating a Basic Handle</h3>
        <p>The Basic Handle can be just used like a bookmark or a tag. You can use a common word, like "blog", "game" or "bitcoin" to reference to an onchain content. This word can be used to tag many transactions and thus become some kind of overview. At the same time, you can use a more specific handle - or a password - to access files more privately.</p>
        <p>A step-by-step-guide to create a basic handle:</p>
        <img src="basic-handle-1.png" width="500px" />
        <p>You have a picture - here is one of my Dog Ruedie - on the blockchain. To access it you usually go to some kind of content-explorer like <a href="https://bico.media/0478a101336483d878bccec3c82bb97e8aea7f0c3c4dbf65c1ef910957b558c8">bico.media</a> and search for the transaction ID. This is very unconvenient, as you hardly memorize the transaction ID.</p>
        <p>To make it easier, you can create a MetaHandle, either by clicking in the top menue on <a href="create.php">"create"</a> or by just typing the handle you want in the search field and clicking on the "create" button. In this case the handle form will already know the name of your handle.</p>
        <img src="basic-handle-2.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>After doing so you land on the creation page. Here you can paste in your transaction ID, set a title and a description.</p>
        <img src="basic-handle-3.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>Handle name, transaction ID, title and description are the minimum required fields. But there are more options for your handle:</p>
        <img src="basic-handle-4.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>There are two checkboxes. The first allows you to encrypt the transaction id in the handle. This can help you to keep a private collection of handles safe against injections. If you use a password for your private handles, like a private bookmarking list, this is recommended.</p><p>The next option is to publicize the handle. If you activate it, the handle name will be stored in our (offchain) database and announced on the frontpage of MetaHandle.net. This might help you to get pubclicity for your content.</p>
        <img src="basic-handle-5.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>Further, you can add up to three tags to your handle. If someone searched those tags on Metahandle.net, like "bestdog", "pet", "animal", "dog", he will find the handle. The next option, "add value", will create a <a href="#value">Value Handle</a>, which we will explain in the next section.</p>
        <p>After you filled the handle form, you click on the "Create Handle" button. Then you will be forwarded to the next site - you have to initiate the transaction.</p>
        <img src="basic-handle-6.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>On the checkout you can initiate the transaction either with <a href="https://www.moneybutton.com">Monybutton</a> or with <a href="https://github.com/libitx/proxypay">ProxyPay</a>. Please be careful with ProxyPay, it is a nice concept, but sometimes not so reliable.</p>
        <p>After the handle is created, you are forwarded to the search results for this handle. And as we see - we can now access my dog Ruedie very easily.</p>
        <img src="basic-handle-7.jpg" width="500px" />
        <h3 id="value">Create a Value Handle</h3>    
        <p>When you create an Handle, you have the option to add value. This basically means that the handle transaction will have another output with monetary value in BSV. As long as this output is unspent, the handle will be valid. Since you can chose the address by yourself, the coins will fully remain under your control.</p>
        <p>When there are several handles on the same word - like with <a href="search.php?handle=blog">the tag "blog"</a> - they are sorted by value. Also, if the same handle for the same transaction exists twice, only the one with the highest value is shown. This allows you to use Value Handles to update an Handle.</p>
        <img src="value-handle-1.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>To create one you do the same like <a href="#basic">creating a basic handle</a> - but you also set an address and an amount. I used <a href="https://electrumsv.io/">Electrum SV</a> to create a new address and write in the description for what it is used. With Electrum you have the option to free coins, so the input you receive will. </p>
        <img src="value-handle-2.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>Then paste the address in the field, and set an amount in Satoshi to add to the Handle. This is how your handle creation form should look like:</p>
        <img src="value-handle-3.jpg" width="500px" />
        <p>After you set this, just click on the "Create Handle" button and initiate the transaction with MoneyButton or ProxyPay. You created a Value Handle. But beware that you don't spent the output accidently.</p>
        <h3 id="exclusive">Create an Exclusive Handle</h3>
        </p>    
            You don't want to forget an onchain file you found? Just store it as a handle.</p><p>Click on the Store button, set a handle, copy the transaction id, write a title and a description. If you want to use your handle only as a private bookmark, activate encryption of the txid. If you want your handle to be publicly shown on the metahandle site, activate "publicize handle". In this case your handle will be stored in our database.</p>
        <p>When you have stored your handle you can access your files by crawling the handle.</p>
        <h3>Data Structure</h3>
        <p>The data structure of MetaHandles is very simple. It can be extended with further use cases:</p>
        <p><em>OP_RETURN '1NYJFDJbcSS2xGhGcxYnQWoh4DAjydjfYU' H(handle) VersionNumber txid E(title) E(description) salt</em></p>
        <p>A MetaHandle is an OP_RETURN output of a transaction containing these parts:</p>
        <p><b>s0: BitCom address.</b><br /> The address 1NYJFDJbcSS2xGhGcxYnQWoh4DAjydjfYU identifies a transaction as a handle. I registered it as a application with the BitCom protocol. It would not have been needed now, but will make it easier to filter the blockchain on scale.</p>
        <p><b>s1: Hash of Handle.</b><br /> A hash of the handle. This has the effect that you can only find the handle if you actually know it. It prevents arbitrary searchability of handles, while allowing everybody to use them privately. I used SHA256.</p>
        <p><b>s2: VersionNumber</b><br />VersionNumber is in format 010101 and explains how to decrypt a handle. First two digits specify the main type of handle, second two digits the subtype, and last two digits the version of it. This allows to create a large variety of handles and to release updated versions of it. Currently version 010102 and 010202 exist.</p>
        <p><b>s3: txid</b><br />The transaction ID of the onchain content the handles references to. In 010102 it is unencrypted, in 010202 it is encrypted. Encryption helps to protect private handles against face entries, but it eliminates cross references, which is why the default handles stores the unencrypted.</p>
        <p><b>s4 + s5: Title and Description</b><br />Title and Description of the handle are encrypted with AES, using the Handle itself as a password and the salt in s6. Encryption is not made to provide absolute secrecy - it can given a strong password as a handle - but rather to prevent searchabillity.
        <h3>How to use MetaHandles</h3>
        <p>There are many methods to use MetaHandles. They are just a human readable reference to a transaction ID. Some suggestions how to use it:</p>
        <p><b>Handle = Password</b><br /> Use the handle as your private list of bookmarked content onchain. You can use as many passwords as you want. My current implementation only querries 20 entries for each handle, but this can easily be changed in the future. For private lists it is recommended to encrypt the txid.</p>
        <p><b>Handle = Username</b><br />
        Use the handle to curate your list of favorite onchain content. </p>
        <p><b>Handle = Document Name</b><br />Reference a single document file like "myimportantfile-2019-07-13.pdf". </p>
        <p><b>Handle = Tag</b><br />Make onchain content searchable by reference it with a tag. As an example you could look at the <a href="metahandle.php?handle=Games">Handle "Games"</a>. Another example is <a href="metahandle.php?handle=Metahandle">the tag Metahandle itself</a>. Here we store important information about MetaHandles.</p>
        <h3>Collissions</h3>
        <p>MetaHandles are <b>not</b> collission resistent. You can create as many of the same handles as you like.</p>
        <p>For searching purposes like tagging of content this is not a but, but a feature: It allows to make the MetaNet searchable. In the future there will be a need to create algorithms to sort handles (due to age, likes, attached BSV ...)</p>
        <p>For some purposes any collision is unwanted. If you have your private collection of bookmarks, you don't want anybody to be able to introduce collisions in your files. Even if you use a strong password, an attacker would be able to copy your handle and replace the txid. This would not do much harm, but be an inconvenience. For this private collections should encrypt the txid too. This makes them resistent against collision.</p>
        <p>It is possible to create public collision resistent schemes on top of MetaHandles. There could be types of validated / signed Handles and a BitCom instruction mandating that only the valid handle is showed.</p>
        <h3>Further cases</h3>
        <p>The current implementation of MetaHandles is only made to allow to remember and tag files. This was the reason I had the idea and created it, after I realized that it is not hard to do so. But in the process I realized that you can use MetaHandles for a large variety of purporses:</p>
        <p><b>Attestation / Validation</b><br />It is possible to attach a signature signed by the private key for the address having created the onchain content. This would validate a handle and could give it some kind of authorative state. Such a handle type is something I want to create in the close future, but it requires to improve the sorting and querrying algorithm.</p>
        <p><b>Domain Name System:</b><br />On base of validated handles you could build a domain name system for the MetaNet. I already have some scheme in mind I think could allow you to basically create a domain system with a set of handles.</p>
        <p><b>Information has Value</b><br />The MetaNet merges information and value. Value of attached BSV  for example as an unspent output in the transaction creating the content - should be an obvious indicator of how important any content is. On scale it might be needed to attach BSV to a information to make sure that it is not pruned from most nodes. However, it is hard to attach BSV to a transaction ID after you sent it, and even harder if not the content creator but someone else wants to preserve the information. With MetaHandles you can easily attach value to any txid: Reference it and leave an unspent output in the handle transaction.</p><p>        In the same regard, sorting MetaHandles by value can help to create an internet, in which information and value are tightly merged. You can also allow users to like (or dislike) a handle by creating a transaction referencing to a handle an having unspent outputs.</p>
        <p><b>Technical References</b><br />You can use the TXID as the handle. This would allow to querry additional information for any TXID. Such a technical handle allows to add all kind of metadata to a TXID, like announcing that it is outdated and redirecting to a newer version, or instructions to the maintainer of block explorers how to handle the content.</p>
